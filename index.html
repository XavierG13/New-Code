        I am currently working for Planet Fitness as an MSR. One of my passions is strength and coditioning which I do
        on the side to help others achieve their goals and better their lifestyles. I also enjoy hands on activities
        such as model kits, pc building, and just recently coding. I have a Border Collie named Finnick who is off the
        walls full of energy. My biggest milestone is coming up where I will be getting married to my high school sweet
        heart next year on June 13th. I am looking forward to this new chapter in my life, it is exciting and a bit
        terrifying.
